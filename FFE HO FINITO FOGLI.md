Recap project management 

innovation process is starting when the project is officially formalized

identify the PM , cna be chosen or it is a professional

Sponsor of the project - Senior manager, in a small compan y even the CEO 

PM Office for big projects to support the PM , complex project like new factory or new portfolio

Ecosystem - STAKEHOLDERS important to keep in mind ewhen you develop the project have direct or indirect interests, can block or facilitate the project, internal or external supplier, 
managers, company guys
customers, authorities

approval from health minister for ntraceutical

nutritional claim -> prepare the science community to know what they think, you 

How to identify them:
- whose taking benefit
- which function in the co willl be impacted 
- who has to support the project
- what the risk in not considering the stakeholders
- who can decide:
	- you need a new comanufacturer
	- need to introduce a partner to the project, can have an impact but can't choose unlike the chief who can stop the project
	- having a chat or regular meeting 

can be + or -, passiv eor active. external or internal

someone focused on the output usually forgets the stakeholders.

budget 
money not allocated then you cannot start the project, to issue an order, who are the people to get approved to move funds

how many people do i need? in FTU what kind? what competencies?

time to get the project done, expected timeline (icecream must be distributed before april) seasonality on the market and on the customers

Project Charter 
erly project brief

Planning and desing phase

team
function involved
eg
process engineer for 6 months half of his time (need a specific person not a full time equivalent)

outsourcing - consultants or temporary employees

project brief document having all the elements needed

activity plan and risk analysis are important

planning the project

activities with timeing 

the interdependencies among them, in parallel or in sequence (first approval fo capital investment than buy the plant, installation, assessment, production)->GANTT 

Risk Analysis 

matrix of the risks

BUFFER (25% or 30%): 
keep a percentage of the total cost not allocated but kept to face extra activity or extra cost.
Not too conservative or the project is not approved. 

Steering team (stakeholders)

PM

Project team

functions with their team

role of the porject manager, why important what are the key actions

PM puts together the gate keepers 

control not going in deep or it's complex, the right measure
which level of risk do you want to manage

team executing, pm is monitoring

that is a continuos plan to make sure all the actions are executed as planned, 
you get late you could create a butterfly effect on other activities

Expected risk that happen so you execute what you planned in risk assessment 

Risk that didn't happen so can be removed
(leave umbrella at home, it didn't rain)

unexpected risk?

ISSUES
problem in the proejct if not well managed will impact negatively the project

root cause
analysis classification promote discussion to solve, potential actions what are the impacts

very critical issue:
PM escalates, bring the issue to the stakeholders, not minor one

never bring a problem without a solution, so you show leadership, if you bring just problem you just create panic

Prepare regular report of the project and manage approval

when you stop execution and monitoring? when you arrived to the end

PM has to decide if the project is successful , what are the parameters

there can be
Multiple scope of the project

once it's working it is not a project anymore

when a project is closed, 
now become a routine, has to be handed to new people like factory manager
critical moment
maybe not all info are handed, there can be problems in this 
handover

In post launch PM can be back to take KPI for the post launch evaluation

if something goes wrong he has to keep a record, to learn from mistake, to be stronger, you have to understand why it failed.
Fire people who do not learn from their mistake.

Lesson 13

GANTT
sequences are dangerous you got late for all actions, you can take risk and do things in parallel on label you get nutrional value, a lot of time you make analysis on industrial sample, to put on the label, if this takes 2 weeks, you can take risk and make an estimate, then you adjust slightly the values

if analysis are totally different you lose time and money

pros GANTT

easy
good control
easy to update and understand

cons

interdipendencies are not represented os can be risky sometimes
no sensitivity on activity ()

when the project is complex the GANTT presents to risk

so you need software that to the reticualr complex techniques for you

BUDGET

capturing all the costs direct and direct
internal external

variable fixed

better to know them previously because they can pop up in the future dangerously

Forecast and update as you go to update the stakeholders 

Earned Value

method to quantify cost and return (no need to know)

Resources:
- tools
- people
you have to define what you need, and make sure they are available when you need them

How many people you need

resources are fluctuating FTE non lo so
